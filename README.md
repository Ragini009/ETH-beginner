MyToken, a smart contract developed in Solidity version 0.8.18 and released under the MIT License, is a rudimentary implementation of an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. The token name ("James"), token abbreviation ("JAS"), and total supply are all public variables. A mapping is included in the contract to record the token balances connected to every address. With the syntax mint(address add1, uint value1), it offers a mint function that raises the overall supply of tokens and adds the designated amount to the balance of a specific address. It also features a burn function with the syntax burn(address add1, uint), which reduces the overall supply and subtracts the designated amount from the address's balance to make sure it has enough money before burning.Using the mint and burn functions, deploy the contract on a blockchain that is compatible with Ethereum to control the supply and distribution of tokens. Solidity documentation and Ethereum development tools can be used as a guide.
